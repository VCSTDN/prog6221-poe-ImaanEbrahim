Description of Changes Based on Feedback:
I have enhanced the SANELESAPP_WPF application based on feedback received from my lecturer. Key improvements include:

Code Structuring: Implemented clearer separation of concerns by introducing a class library.

User Interface: Transitioned from a command-line interface to a more intuitive graphical user interface using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). This allows users to interact with the application seamlessly through buttons and tables, enhancing user experience.

Documentation: Improved code documentation by adding more comments to clarify variable names, methods, and overall logic. This helps in maintaining and understanding the codebase.

Feel free to explore the repository for more details and to provide any feedback.
